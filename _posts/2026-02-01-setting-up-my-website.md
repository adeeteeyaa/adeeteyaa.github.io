title: Setting Up My Website
description: My first blog post on this website about setting up this website.

This is my first post on my website.

I guess eventually, this is going to be a post on how I created and set up this website. More to follow.

# Framework
Jekyll.

I've created a lot of websites over the years. In fact, one of my first websites I created back in 2010 is still on the internet somewhere - [ElectroWiz](https://electrowiz.yolasite.com), created by Adi Corp, my fictitious corporate entity.
